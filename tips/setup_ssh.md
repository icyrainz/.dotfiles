1.  `ssh-keygen -t rsa`: This command generates a new SSH key pair. The `-t rsa` option specifies that the key should be of the type RSA. RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. When you run this command, it will prompt you for a file in which to save the key. Pressing enter at each prompt will accept the default values. This will create a private key (`id_rsa`) and a public key (`id_rsa.pub`) in the `~/.ssh/` directory.
    
2.  `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`: This command appends the contents of your public key to the `authorized_keys` file. The `authorized_keys` file in SSH specifies the SSH keys that can be used for logging into the user account for which the file is configured. By appending your public key to this file, you're authorizing the corresponding private key to access this account.
    
3.  `chmod og-wx ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`: This command changes the permissions of the `authorized_keys` file. The `chmod` command in UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems is used to change the permissions of a file or directory. In this case, `og-wx` means that write (`w`) and execute (`x`) permissions are being removed for other (`o`) users and group (`g`) users. This is a security measure to prevent other users from modifying or executing this file, as the `authorized_keys` file should be kept secure.
